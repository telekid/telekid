### Howdy! 🤠
I'm Jake.

I spend my working hours at [Flexport](https://www.flexport.com), where I help shipments clear customs around the world.

Outside of work, I explore the intersection between music, music theory and functional programming. Oh, and I spend a lot of time playing outside (⛷ | 🚴‍♂️ | 🧗‍♂️ | 🚶‍♂️), too.
